# Assigned functions can be found in the func.cpp file
# Main.cpp is used to give a GUI and let the user test the functions
# input.txt is the file that the program uses to initialize the array

# For the try/catch implementations, they are present at the bottom of the func.cpp file, with TC having been added to the name to denote them
# The original functions without the try/catch are present only to organize different levels of the assignment.
